#Firstly, download the dataset that contains the facial expressions from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apollo2506/facial-recognition-dataset. The first block of code in the Python notebook will prompt the user to upload a file, please upload the zip file downloaded which should be named “archive.zip”. From here, run all subsequent blocks of code excluding the fully commented out blocks, and the blocks of code at the end which contain models that yielded worse results. These models are found underneath a header that appears after all models have been trained. 

#All testing was done on Google Colab

#The First model is the from scratch Model
#The next one is ResNet50, then MobileNetV2 and Lastly InceptionV3
#The next segments are our Ensemble model and gradio for an interactive interface to test each model

#Please Note, All code underneath the Gradio Segment should not be run. Those are earlier tested keras models that had poor performance

#Made with Ajay Sodhi and Justin Chiu
